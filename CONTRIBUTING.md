Contributing to `bang.sh` is a volunteer effort.

Bug reporting can be done via *issues*. It would be nice that the issue had the following information:
 * The wrong observed behaviour
 * How the expect behaviour would be
 * Sample code that reproduces the wrong behaviour

Submitting a patch is easy and can be done via Pull Request following these steps:
 * Fork the project
 * Create a branch with a meaning name
 * Open a Pull Request against `bellthoven/bang.sh` master branch with the description of the feature or bug fix

Welcome aboard and thanks! :heart:
